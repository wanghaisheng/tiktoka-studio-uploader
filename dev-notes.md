Do I need a computer for running the bot?
Yes, but you can also run it directly on your phone!!

In any case, you can decide to use a physical device or an emulator. If you're under Windows I suggest you use Memu, under Mac OS we found out that Android studio works well (Installable with homebrew). For hosting the bot you can use:

your computer (with Windows, macOS, or Linux)
a Raspberry (which is a cheap little pc Linux based)
